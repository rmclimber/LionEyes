# LionEyes

The genesis of this project was my sister's face-to-face encounter with a cougar
outsider her home in the Sierra Nevada foothills. (The cougar was killing two of
her baby goats.) She was unhurt, but the cougar was never successfully found. 
I thought how convenient it would be if she had a system which would alert her
to the presence of a cougar on her property. As a newcomer to machine learning,
this seemed like a great project to develop. 

In broad strokes, my plan is to create an end-to-end ML project using computer
vision to classify inputs from security and game cameras as containing (or not
containing) a mountain lion. (For the non-native English speakers, 'mountain
lion', 'cougar', and 'puma' are all synonyms and the colloquial terms for
*Puma concolor*.)

Below, I outline the planned phases of the project. I will revise these as my
knowledge base expands. 

After completion of each phase, I also intended to write a short analysis of the
work: the approach taken, successes and failures, etc. 

## Phase 1: data acquisition and preparation
## Phase 2: building and training the model
## Phase 3: building a GUI for practical use
## Phase 4: adding video 
## Phase 5: adding live monitoring
## Phase 6: adding push notifications
## Phase 7: deployment to cloud
## Phase 8: add additional predators
